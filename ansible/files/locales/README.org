The file =en_US_custom_start-week-on-sat= is a copy of =/usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US=, adding "=first_weekday 7=" to the =LC_TIME= block.
The purpose is to make the week start on Saturday.

After the file is changed, you must run:
=sudo localedef -f UTF-8 -i en_US_custom_start-week-on-sat en_US_custom_start-week-on-sat.utf-8=

To use this file for clock/calendar data, run =LC_TIME=en_US_custom_start-week-on-sat.utf8= or add =export LC_TIME=en_US_custom_start-week-on-sat.utf8= to wherever you keep ENV variables.

If you're making changes to this file to effect the waybar clock, restart it with =killall waybar && waybar & > /dev/null=
